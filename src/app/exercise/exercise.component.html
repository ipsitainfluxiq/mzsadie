                    <h1>Thinking about exercise</h1>
                    <h2><span>Virtually every medical and scientific authority agrees that exercise plays a major role in achieving optimal health.  If exercise is so good for us in so many different ways, why doesn’t everyone exercise like mad?  The truth is that people do not like to exercise.  It is not because they are lazy, but because exercise has actually been evolutionarily selected against.  Huh?</span>


                      <span>Think about it.  All our behavior today actually stem from the physiology and biochemistry that we inherited from our cave dwelling ancestors.  In long past days, obtaining enough food to live was very difficult.  Life for our ancestors was actually pretty mundane.  They hunted, ate and conserved fuel so they could live another day.  The hunting process gave them the exercise they needed to remain healthy during the thirty-some years that they lived.  Expending extra energy would have been counterproductive both from a conservation of energy standpoint and an interaction with a hostile environment standpoint.</span>


                      <span> It would have been selected against evolutionarily.
Today, things are different, of course.  We have comfortable, plush gyms and wonderful running shoes.  We have extra time and our hunting is done in the meat case of the local grocery.  We over-eat food fuels and have more than enough energy stores to complete a daily exercise program.  But nonetheless, these are very recent changes in the entire history of mankind and the gene software running our physiology is still sending “don’t exercise” signals out to the body.  When we understand this, then we have a chance to overcome it.   Forget about the idea that a desire to exercise should come naturally to you.  It does not.  Often time you have to force yourself to get started before it actually becomes pleasurable.  Maybe a start for you is just moving around more and that is fine because you have created a change.</span>


                      <span>The word exercise actually comes from the root word “exert” meaning to exert one’s power or influence.  The act of exerting your physical body requires movement.  There are many ways to move your body and gain health and fitness benefits.

                    <h2>There are three basic ways to think about movement of the body:</h2>

                      <h1>Flexibility</h1>
                      <h2><span>Flexibility is a huge part of functional movement and of improved performance.  Technically speaking, flexibility is defined as the range of motion possible surrounding a particular joint.  So in order to understand the potential for this type of movement, we first need to understand joints.</span>

                        <span>A joint connects bones with cartilage and ligaments.  The synovial joints, also referred to as diarthroses joints, contain fluid and are freely movable.  They include the hinge joints and the ball and socket joints. We will focus our attention on these two joint types since they are the primary joints that allow motion to occur in the body.</span>

                        <span>Hinge joints can perform flexion and extension, like the knee does when we lift or lower the body or the elbow does as we bend the arm to pick up a weight.</span>

                        <span>The ball and socket joints have increased potential for movement because of the design of the joint and the number of muscle attachments.  They can move in circular motion like when a softball pitcher throws a pitch.  Or they can rotate up and down, in and out, with the wrist rotating in many directions, just like when you play ping pong.  The ball and socket joint can also create abduction and adduction by moving away from or toward the midline of the body.  An example of this would be when you do standing side lunges.</span>

                        <span>It is extremely important to maintain good flexibility in your various joints.  Not only will inflexibility increase the risk for injury for the joint and the muscle, but limitations of movement in sport affects both performance and musculoskeletal health.</span></h2>
                    </div>
                    <h2><span>These movement limitations, generally, can be caused by ligament tension, poor muscle flexibility and touching of soft tissue such as the calf against the hamstring or soft tissue of the torso touching the thigh when stretching the hamstrings. There are additional factors that impact your functional flexibility.   For example, age and inactivity are critical variables.  Obviously, you cannot do anything about your age but you can do a lot about how active you are.   Not only do you need to work out on most days of the week, you need to be physically active throughout the day.  If you work at a desk job, it will be very important that you get up and move around about every 30 minutes.  If you have a physically demanding job like running a gym or you work in retail and are on your feet all day, make sure you stretch the major joints periodically throughout the work day.</span>

                      <h2><span>This It is important to point out the benefits of flexibility and stretching.   Our body instinctively stretches. Think about when you first get out of bed in the morning or after taking a long walk or after sitting for a long period of time.  We all feel the need to elongate the joint and increase circulation.  The act of stretching alone increases circulation and improves blood flow to the muscles.  We know when there is more blood flow, more nourishment is given to the muscles and waste byproducts are removed. Another benefit of stretching is to eliminate pain.  A common area of pain in 80% of people is the lower back.  Muscles that are tight in the hip and leg area including the quadriceps, hamstrings and hip flexors can cause back pain.   A nice gentle stretch can often eliminate the pain all together.</span>

                        <span>Stretching is also good for the heart.  Recent studies support the fact that stretching lowers blood pressure and improves the function of the arteries in the body. Finally, flexibility stretching helps reduce the day to day stress we all experience.</span>

                        <span>Flexibility is all about maximizing the range of motion in a joint or set of joints so you can move freely and optimize functional mobility.   Just because you age, you don’t need to lose the flexibility of your youth.  Keep in mind that it is a myth that you lose flexibility as you age.  Actual research shows that you simply move less as you get old and it is because you quit moving that you lose mobility.  Again, aging muscles are not a direct cause of lack of flexibility.  The truth is that we value convenience over activity so we find many short cuts to minimize stretching, i.e. buying loafers instead of shoes that need to be tied, using remote controls instead of getting up and changing the channel and lower cabinets so we don’t have the need to reach.</span>

                        <span>Without an active flexibility program featuring good stretches, this important element of exercise tends to get forgotten.</span></h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block2-sec4">
                      <h1>Stretching</h1>
                      <h2><span>Before you continue reading, we want you to stand up and reach as high as you can with both hands, hold it and reach up a little bit higher.  Doesn’t that feel great!  Now we are going to talk about stretching and how it impacts flexibility and your life. Our avoidance of stretching activities is why this  information is so important.  We will discuss five key elements of stretching that will help you understand the “why” behind the benefits of being flexible.  Hopefully this information will educate and motivate everyone to get active and stretching.</span></h2>
                      <ul class="stretchlist">
                        <li><span>First,</span> we need to understand that stretching can be either dynamic or static.  Dynamic (involving motion) flexibility, also called kinetic flexibility, is the ability to perform fluid movements of muscles using full range of motion.  Very often this is a bouncing type of movement.  Conversely, static (involving no motion) flexibility is the ability to assume and maintain a position using the tension of the opposing muscle groups.  An example of static stretching would be to reach forward to a point of tension and hold.  Most researchers and coaches prefer static over dynamic stretching initially due to the reduced risk of injury since momentum is not involved in static stretches.  We agree.  If you are a beginner, start with static stretches.  As you warm up and improve your body awareness and skill you can move to more advanced methods of stretching.</li>
                        <li><span>Second,</span> stretching is joint specific.  In other words, just because you can touch your toes does not mean you are flexible!  It simply means you have adequate flexibility in the hip in the forward bend position.   For most joints in the body there must be functional range of motion and with every joint the range is different based on the type of joint it is as well as the tendon, ligament and muscle configuration and attachments.  For example, the hinge joint in your knee and elbow has different ranges of motion compared to the hip and shoulder which is a ball and socket joint.  So first learn the primary joints in your body that are linked to locomotion and movement like the neck, shoulder, chest, back, arms, hips, legs and ankle.  Then select a stretching routine that you can do daily that will benefit each joint.</li>
                        <li><span>Third,</span> stretching improves the range of motion (ROM) of joints.  ROM is the “normal” amount that your joints can move in a certain direction without causing injury.  It is important to have full movement in each movable joint to reduce the risk of injury and to improve physical mobility and performance.  The different stretches can be done in a number of ways; active range of motion (AROM), active assisted range of motion (AAROM), self range of motion (SROM) and passive range of motion (PROM).</li>
                        <li><span>Fourth,</span> stretching increases circulation.  We know circulation moves nutrients and oxygen into the cell, removes waste, and keeps the pH level in order.  Here is the bad news - if a person is not active, (i.e. they sit at a computer or desk, in a car or on the couch for long periods of time); they might have a circulation problem.  Most people notice circulation problems in their hands and feet first.   A simple remedy is to move around, and specifically, to stretch your muscles. In fact, a natural reaction after sitting for a long period of time is to stretch. The neurological system sends a message to the physiological system to move.  A general stretch is fine.  Stick out your arms, arch your back, touch your toes, wiggle your fingers, roll your shoulders or just stop and simply listen to your body and you will know exactly what to stretch to get the oxygen and nutrients moving.</li>
                        <li><span>Fifth,</span> stretching can relieve stress!  We all experience stress.  So how does stretching relieve stress?  This is simple. When the muscles are elongated, circulation is stimulated thus relieving the tension in the muscle.  We experience tension in a variety of ways including tension headaches, hand and arm fatigue, neck and shoulder tension, leg cramps sleeplessness, and depression.  The solution to stress is to get moving! Years ago, it was thought that stretching prior to exercise was a great deterrent to injuries, however, as the result of a great deal of scientific research, we now know that you should never stretch a muscle that hasn’t been sufficiently warmed up with exercise or vigorous activity.  For most everyone, that means that stretching before a workout is a very bad idea.  In fact, today, studies support the fact that stretching is most beneficial following a workout.   We now know, for certain, that it is important to elongate a muscle (stretch) only after it has been placed under contraction from vigorous use.  Another benefit to stretching post exercise is to aid relaxation and to promote recovery after a workout.</li>

                      <h2 class="borderleft"><span>Understand the physiology of stretching as it relates to joints and muscle connection and the benefits of flexibility stretching is only part of the equation.  Now it is time to take action and incorporate stretching into daily life.  Here are the points to remember in order to best accomplish this important change:</span></h2>
                      <ul class="stretchlist2">
                        <li>Most studies find that you need to stretch most every joint in your body three or more times per week to maximize optimal range of motion.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that you stretch the muscle and supporting tissue only when the muscles are warm.  Therefore, the best time to stretch and increase your range of motion is right after you exercise or have been physically active for a period of time.  Avoid stretching a cold muscle as this will increases your risk for injury.</li>
                        <li>When you are stretching it is very important to stay in proper alignment all through the motion ending with a mildly elongated point and holding there.  Never push the stretch to the point of pain.  Allow neurological messaging to occur between the muscle and brain for about 10-30 seconds and then you can reach a little more and take the stretch a bit further.  The stretch should be performed in a gently, fluid and slow progressive way.  Avoid ballistic/bounce stretching of a muscle or muscle group as this can increase the risk of muscle strains or tears.</li>
                        <li>Finally, make sure you are breathing through the stretch.  The muscles need the oxygen and this helps the circulation process as well.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2 class="borderleft"><span>Keep in mind you can stretch almost anywhere and at any time.  You don’t need specific equipment, a personal trainer or a gym and the benefits of stretching are immediate and long-lasting.   So let’s all stand up and reach for the stars!  Hold it….breath….relax! We want to encourage you to incorporate different stretches throughout your day…keep the circulation moving and the joints limber.</span></h2>

                      <h1>Yoga & Pilates</h1>
                      <h2><span>There are two very popular forms of stretching exercises, yoga and pilates.  These are specific activities that can help improve your flexibility because they are grounded in stretching and muscle tension.</span></h2>
                      <div class="exercise-block2-sec6con">

                        <h2><span>Yoga is a form of exercise designed to enhance both physical and mental health.  Yoga started in India more than three thousand years ago. The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit word “yuj” which means “to unite or integrate” so it is the practice of uniting your individual consciousness with the universe.  Ancient Yogis believed that in order to be in harmony with himself and his environment, he has to integrate the body, mind and spirit.  Everything must come into balance.   The balance is achieved through exercise, breathing and meditation.  For the sake of this lesson, we will focus on the exercise benefit.</span>


                          <span>Yoga exercise increases circulation, stimulates abdominal organs and puts pressure on the glandular system, which can generally improve health.  A typical yoga session might be 10- 15 minutes or more of basic stretches like pelvic tilts for the hips and lower back, cat stretches for the spine, the downward facing dog for the torso arms and legs, lunges for the hips and legs, raised arm pose for upper body, touching your toes for the hamstrings and ending with a corpse pose to relax and absorb the benefits of the stretching session.</span>

                          <span>Joseph H. Pilates studied yoga, martial arts and other ancient mind body activities that create the foundation of the practice of Pilates.  This form of movement blends the elements of stretching, endurance and strength training into one exercise event.  Pilates is very popular with athletes, dancers, gymnasts and a lot of Hollywood celebrities due to both the end results physiologically and the rapid appearance of the sculpted body.  The techniques can be very simple to very complex and can be made appropriate for any age group or gender.  You can engage in floor Pilates or purchase a Pilates machine called a reformer.  The practice helps reduce blood pressure and stress, enhances flexibility, breathing, energy and overall muscle toning.  Pilates, like yoga, connects the mind and body through movement.  We recommend that you train with an instructor, sign up for a course or purchase a good DVD to help you get started.</span>

                        The term aerobic literally means "with oxygen."  Oxygen is the cornerstone for healthy, active living.   The oxygen from the air we breathe is delivered to the body’s tissues and organs through the cardiovascular system.  A part of that overall system, respiration, supplies oxygen, eliminates carbon dioxide, and helps regulate the acid-base balance (pH) of the body.  Energy is produced when adequate oxygen is delivered to the cell to meet the energy demands. When activity increases and intensity is greater, the cardio system tries to deliver oxygen to the muscle to aerobically produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate).</h3>

                      <h2><span>The amount of oxygen taken from hemoglobin and used in exercising muscle cells is referred to as oxygen extraction.  The extent to which we are able to supply larger amounts of oxygen to our muscles and organs during activity is the extent to which we improve our conditioning and overall cardiovascular and muscular health.</span>

                        <span>If you are engaged in an aerobic exercise, your body can produce enough energy to sustain that activity for an extended amount of time.  When you fatigue, energy can no longer be produced at that level.  Fatigue is a function of many varied factors including ones individual physiology and exercise intensity level.  Even age affects fatigue due to the fact that as we grow older we have an increase need for oxygen and are therefore quicker to fatigue during exercise.</span>

                        <span>Regardless of anyone's current level of conditioning or age, the benefits of aerobic exercise seem to be limitless.  Whether you are an Olympic athlete or a housewife, you can benefit greatly from regular aerobic activity.  It's a given fact that body composition changes with regular exercise.  Aerobic exercises, however, burns fat faster than any other type of exercise.  The results of this include the following:  less body fat, more muscle mass, a lower resting heart rate, an improved cardio capacity, greater bone density and an improvement in metabolism, in the form of resting energy expenditure.  The net result of the changes is the capacity to burn more calories at rest.  We also know that engaging in regular aerobic activities suppresses the appetite while allowing for increased daily calorie intake. Cardiovascular training also has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to insulin.  That makes aerobics critical for a type 1 or type 2 diabetic or for a person with metabolic syndrome. Aerobic activities that involve weight bearing activities, like walking and jogging, are additionally important as they help to build the skeletal system.  These activities help reduce the risk for osteoporosis and other bone deficiencies.</span>

                        <span>Since cardiovascular disease is still the number one killer and we know that aerobic activities strengthen the heart, it goes without saying that a person with coronary artery disease would benefit from regular aerobic exercise.  High blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, increased HDL, decreased LDL and arthritis improvement are more reasons to engage in regular aerobic exercise.</span>

                        <span>To truly benefit from aerobic training you must do one of the following two necessary things:</span>

                        <span>elevate the heart rate to your individual training zone (target heart rate), or reach a level of perceived exertion. </span></h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block3con4">
                      <h3>The best formula to determine your training zone or target heart rate is the Karvonen Formula.  The formula is pretty simple.  Basically it is your maximum heart rate minus your resting heart rate multiplied by the desired exercise intensity.  Then you add your resting heart rate to that number and you have your target heart rate.</h3>

                      <h3>Training Heart Rate = (maximum heart rate minus resting heart rate)  x desired exercise intensity (50-85% is the spread to choose from)+resting heart rate.</h3>

                      <h3>The hardest part of this calculation is actually determining your maximum heart rate.  Your maximum heart rate (MHR) is the fastest rate at which your heart will beat in one minute.  The typical way we calculate MHR is with the formula 220-age.  This formula is a bit controversial because it doesn't reflect the differences in heart rate according to age.  A more accurate formula, offered in a study published in the journal, Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, is 206.9 - (0.67 x age).  Here is how these calculations differ.  If you are 60 years old, using the older, less precise formula you have 220-60=160 as the MHP.  Using the better revised formula you have 206.9-(40) or 169.9 (rounded up to 170). </h3>

                      <h3>Once you get the MHP the rest is just simple math.  Let's take an example.</h3>

                      <h3>What is the training heart rate for a 40 year old with a resting heart rate of 80 beats per minute at 70% intensity?</h3>

                      <span>40 x .67 = 26.8; 206.9-26.8 = 180.1 (maximum heart rate)</span>

                      <span>180 (MHR) – 80 (RHR) = 100 (heart rate reserve)</span>

                      <span>100 x 0.70 (70% intensity)  = 70</span>

                      <span>70 + 80 (RHR) = 150 (Target Heart Rate at 70%)</span>

                      <h3>If all those numbers and calculations bother you, the second method of making sure that you get a maximal effect from your aerobic activity involves perceived exertion.    Borg's Scale of Perceived Exertion is a scale with numbers ranging from 6-20.  A score of 6 represents no activity while 20 represents very, very hard and near failure. </h3>

                      <h3>Aerobically, a person needs to perform work between a score of 11 (moderate work intensity) and 15 (hard work intensity) for 20-30 minutes continuously.   We know that as people exercise they rarely do so at a perfectly steady pace so using a range is the best method to keep you in your optimal training zone.</h3>

                      <h3>Be honest when you evaluate your level of exertion.  Do not be concerned with leg pain, cramps, etc.  Just honestly rate what you feel your exertion level is. </h3>

                      <ul>
                        <li>The first zone, healthy heart zone, is usually at 50-60%.  Walkers tend to stay in this zone and as you guessed you can walk for long durations of time and achieve maximum fat burn.  In this zone you usually burn 10% carbs, 5% protein and 85% fat.</li>
                        <li>The second zone is a fitness zone working at 60-70%.  You tend to burn more calories per minute.  Joggers might typify this category.  Keep in mind that the total calories burned depend on distance traveled, your body weight as well as other environmental factors.  The fuel is about the same 10% carbs, 5% protein and 85% from fat.</li>
                        <li>Third, stretching improves the range of motion (ROM) of joints.  ROM is the "normal" amount that your joints can move in a certain direction without causing injury.  It is important to have full movement in each movable joint to reduce the risk of injury and to improve physical mobility and performance.  The different stretches can be done in a number of ways; active range of motion (AROM), active assisted range of motion (AAROM), self range of motion (SROM) and passive range of motion (PROM).</li>
                        <li>The anaerobic threshold zone is next.  This is working at 80-90% of your maximum heart rate.  At this rate you are not talking.  This training method is usually done in intervals or circuit training.  The fuel source is 85% carbs, 15% fat and <1% protein.</li>
                        <li>The last zone is usually called the "red zone" for obvious reasons.  You will be working at 90-100% capacity.  This zone does burn a lot of calories but 90% are usually from carbs, 10% fat and <1% protein.</li>

Carbohydrate is the main food nutrient fueling exercise at moderate to high intensity. Fat provides energy during exercise that occurs at a lower intensity.  Fat is a great fuel for endurance events, but it is simply not adequate for high intensity exercise such as sprints or interval training.  If you exercising at a low intensity (or below 50 percent of max heart rate), you have enough stored fat to fuel activity for hours if not days, given sufficient oxygen to allow fat metabolism to occur.</span>

                        <span>As exercise intensity increases in the moderate zone, carbohydrate metabolism takes over.  Stored carbohydrate in the form of glycogen can fuel about 2 hours of moderate to high level exercise.  After that, glycogen depletion occurs requiring an athlete to refuel with carbs to continue with their aerobic activity.
As exercise intensity increases into the more intense zones, carbohydrate metabolism efficiency falls off and anaerobic metabolism begins.  Anaerobic metabolism takes over because your body can not induct and distribute oxygen quickly enough to use either fat or carbohydrate metabolism easily. With appropriate training, these energy systems adapt and become more efficient and allow greater exercise duration at higher intensity before anaerobic metabolism kicks in.</span>

                      <h1>Anaerobic Exercise</h1>
                      <h2><span>You have learned that the term aerobic means "<span class="pinktext">with oxygen</span>."   Anaerobic ("<span class="pinktext">without oxygen</span>") is another energy system in the body and is the primary source of adenosine triphosphate (<span class="pinktext">ATP</span>) when there is a deficit amount of oxygen in the cell to meet the energy needs during exercise.</span>

                        <span>When it comes to activities such as weight lifting, sprinting and tennis, oxygen is in high demand and short supply, which is why exercises such as these can feel so challenging!  In the absence of enough oxygen, like when performing bench presses or leg presses, the muscles rely mainly on the anaerobic energy system, which has a rapidly available source of ATP.  The anaerobic metabolism functions best using the fast twitch skeletal muscles that lead to anaerobic energy expenditure.</span>

                        <span>According to the American Sports Medicine Institute, anaerobic training is usually less than two minutes in duration and as a result oxygen does not become a factor in performance.  Anaerobic energy sources use phosphagen and lactic acid and enable the individual to perform brief, near maximum muscular activities.  Any activity that last up to 30 seconds in length, relies on the phosphagen energy system while activities that last between 30 seconds and two minutes rely on the lactic acid system.</span>

                        <span>Most often these energy systems are effectively trained using interval conditioning.  However, keep in mind there is no absolute in this equation. </span>

                        <span>Weight lifting is the most popular form of anaerobic training that has the greatest impact on health, body shaping and metabolism.  Keep in mind when we are talking about weight lifting we are not talking about body building.  We are talking about overloading the muscles to improve muscle strength and muscle endurance.  Men have a higher level of testosterone, which means they have more muscle mass and size and it is easier for them to increase muscle fiber size, called hypertrophy.  Women, on the other hand, can increase tone without increasing the size.  For both genders weight training is very beneficial.</span></h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block4con2">
                      <h1>Let's talk about weight training and you.</h1>
                      <ul>
                        <li><span class="pinktext">First,</span> we know that strong muscles can improve your posture and help maintain your equilibrium or balance.  As we age, balance can be a daily challenge and the risk of a fall can delay or limit your daily fitness regime.  Having muscle endurance and strength can also play a role in preventing injuries should a fall occur or if you are choosing to take on more aggressive training routines.  We also know that if we do weight bearing activities we can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and other bone deficiencies.</li>
                        <li><span class="pinktext">Second,</span> having muscle mass that is tight and tone can change the shape of our bodies.  While there is no such thing as “spot reducing,” there is “spot training.”  Weight training allows us to focus on our specific problem areas.  For example, whereas weight training cannot change the elasticity of the skin, it can tighten and tone muscles that are sagging around the under arms and around the upper leg.</li>
                        <li><span class="pinktext">Third,</span> stronger muscles can also make everyday activities easier and more efficient such as mowing the lawn, lifting the children, carrying groceries and doing laundry.</li>

                        <li><span class="pinktext">Fourth,</span> finally, one of the most important benefits of weight training is the impact it has on resting metabolism.  Many studies support the fact that if you can increase your muscle mass, you can burn more calories at rest.  We know that metabolism is the rate at which energy is being burned in the body.  So we are very interested in the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories or baseline you would burn if you slept all day and all night.  There are many factors that impact your BMR like your age, stress level and even the climate you live in.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block4con3">
                      <h2><span>The BMR formula uses the variables of height, weight, age and gender to calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). There are various formulas available on line and even automatic web calculators that do the math for you.  To get a simple, general idea of what your BMR is simply multiply your weight  by 10.  If you weigh 150 pounds then the number of calories you could burn is 1,500.  This is just a general assessment and if you want to get more details there are devices that can calculate the number of calories you can burn per minute.  However, keep in mind the more muscle mass you have compared to fat mass increases the rate at which energy is burned.</span>

                        <span>In addition, studies continue to suggest that vigorous weight lifting can elevate calorie burning above usual values for several hours after you finish working out.  This is a huge benefit from weight lifting.  There is nothing like burning extra calories while you are sitting in your car on the way home from the gym.  This is called the after burn and we weight lifters love this special perk!</span>

                        <span>Continuing on with our journey through the depths of exercise science we want to direct our attention toward building and sustaining muscle through strength and endurance training.  First let’s review the definitions of muscular strength and endurance.  Muscular strength is the ability of the muscle to generate maximum force over a short period of time.  Training for muscular strength usually requires high weight and a low number of reps.  Muscular endurance is the ability of the muscle to generate force over a period of time.  The opposite occurs if you are endurance training; the weight is low and the numbers of reps are high.  We all agree that we need both strength and endurance in our daily lives in order to function effectively and efficiently.  Muscle tissue consists of fibers that generate contractions for motion, posture and heat production.  Muscle tissue is classified into three categories:</span></h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li><span class="pinktext">Cardiac</span> - which are the involuntary heart muscles;</li>
                        <li><span class="pinktext">Smooth</span> - which are located in the internal structures like the
                          blood vessels, stomach and bladder;</li>
                        <li><span class="pinktext">Skeletal</span> - which are attached to the bones and creates
                          movement.  These skeletal muscles vary with respect to
                          metabolic processes they use to generate adenosine
                          triphosphate (ATP).</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block4con4">
                      <h2><span>Our anaerobic exercise training focuses mainly on the skeletal muscles.  Skeletal muscle fibers can be classified as either slow twitch or fast twitch.  Before we get into the different specific ways to overload the muscle, we want to explore the impact of fast twitch and slow twitch on exercise.  Most of us are born with about 50% of each type of fiber.  In extreme cases like an Olympic sprinter or international marathoner, there is a definite genetic predisposition toward having more of one or the other.  Science has shown us that we cannot significantly increase or decrease the numbers of specific muscle fiber types but that they can be anaerobically trained, especially the fast twitch fibers to increase muscle conditioning.</span>

                        <span>Slow twitch or slow oxidative fibers contain myoglobin (an oxygen binding protein found in skeletal muscles), many mitochondria (powerhouses of the cell) and many blood capillaries. These fibers are red, split ATP at a slow rate and have a slow contraction speed.  They are as also very resistant to fatigue.  There are a lot of these fibers found in the postural muscles.  Athletes that have a higher proportion of slow twitch fibers will excel more easily in endurance events such as marathons and cycling in events like the Tour de France.</span>

                        <span>The fast twitch or fast oxidative fibers can deliver more powerful and faster burst of energy. However they fatigue faster than the slow twitch fibers.  They contain very large amounts of myoglobin, very many mitochondria and very many blood capillaries.  These fibers are white and have a high capacity to generate ATP by oxidative metabolic processes.  These fast twitch fibers split ATP at a rapid rate and contract fast.  Most skeletal muscles contain both but their proportion varies depending on the usual action of the muscle.  Strength type of activities like weight lifting and sprinting place a demand on the fast twitch fibers and require immediate and fast contractions.  Runners like Michael Johnson and Usain Bolt probably have a greater proportion of fast twitch fibers compared to slow twitch.  Fast twitch fibers have a great capacity for improvement through appropriate training.</span>

                        <span>Since we are focusing our conversation on strength and endurance training we will be recruiting all the muscle fibers with an emphasis on one or the other depending on high weight and low reps or low weight and high reps.</span>

                        <span>Obviously, success in anaerobic conditioning endeavors is a combination of correct training procedures while in the gym; correct diet or food fueling; and proper support from non-food fueling or supplementation.  If you do not recognize the importance of all three of these areas, get ready to accept failure.   While all three of these have critical importance, right now we are focused on the science behind the first principle:  correct anaerobic training procedures.</span></h2>

                        <h2><span>First, we will discuss "<span class="pinktext">HYPERTROPHY</span>."  Adding muscle tissue is a result of hypertrophy, which is really just the enlarging of muscle cells, most fast twitch cells, which already exist in the body.  The goal of natural muscle gain will always be hypertrophy.</span>

                          <span>Hypertrophy occurs when a muscle adapts to "<span class="pinktext">OVERLOAD</span>."  Overload simply refers to a heavy weight. The heavier the weight, the greater is the muscle overload.  The greater the muscle overload; the more hypertrophy or growth is possible.</span>

                          <span>n order to getter better and better anaerobic conditioning, the muscle must be subjected to heavier and heavier weights. This process is called "<span class="pinktext">PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD</span>."</span>

                          <span>Anaerobic conditioning or muscle tissue growth actually grows according to a process exercise scientists refer to as "<span class="pinktext">OVERCOMPENSATION</span>."  In other words, when fueled properly, the muscle that is subjected to overload in the form of very heavy weight, will first experience stress, then recover and finally grow.  It adapts to the stress state and overcompensates to ready itself for future muscle stresses.</span>

                          <span>The success and rate of hypertrophy or muscle growth is dependent on "<span class="pinktext">MUSCLE FIBER RECRUITMENT</span>."  Generally speaking, the more fibers that are activated the better the growth. During the process of progressive overload, there is a natural increase in the number and type of muscle fibers recruited.  For example, light weights lifted for a large number of repetitions recruit a majority of slow twitch muscle fibers which have a very minimal capacity to grow.  Heavy weights recruit both the slow twitch fibers and fast twitch fibers.  It is the fast twitch fibers that account for a majority of hypertrophy.  As heavier weights are employed, a greater number of fast twitch muscle fibers are recruited and anaerobic conditioning continues.</span>

                          <span>As you can see, the whole process is really very simple.</span>

                          <span>There is one final note on overcompensation.  For overcompensation to occur, it is also important that you eliminate all extraneous movement from the specific exercise.  Extraneous movement creates general momentum, a big enemy to specific muscle overcompensation.  In other words, in every set, you should strive to achieve a non-momentum aided smooth, controlled movement through the entire range of motion.  The angle of force makes no difference whatsoever.  The key is to eliminate momentum.  That is what exercise form is all about.  Think elimination of momentum; rather than how your wrist should be turned, etc.  When a muscle fires forcing a contraction, it is an "all or none process;" the angle of force is a functionally useless concern.  It is as impossible to train a tiny part of a general muscle as it is to "spot reduce" body fat.</span></h2>

                    <h2><span>In order to better understand overload, let's explore our exercise options that include; weight machines like Nautilus and Cybex, free weights, body weight as resistance training, circuit and interval training and balls and bands.</span></h2>
                    <ul class="exercise-block4con5">
                      <li><span class="pinktext">First,</span> First, there are many brands of weight lifting machines designed to overload primary muscle groups. These machines are designed for commercial and home gyms.  The machines can be purchased for individual body parts or as an all-in-one unit.  The primary focus areas on the body would be the chest, back, shoulders, arms, abs and legs.  When performing normal resistance training, it is often preferable to work opposing muscle groups together.  For example, if you work the biceps you need to work the triceps; if you work the quads you need to work the hamstrings; if you work the chest you need to work the back and shoulders. <br><br>

                        Some machines are plate loaded, some use cables and pulleys and some use cams to distribute the selected weight.  If you choose to strength train or endurance train on machines it is important to   make sure the alignment of the machine matches the alignment of your body, to reduce the risk for injury.  For example, if you are on a leg extension or leg curl machine you need to make sure the pivot point of the machine lines up with the pivot point of your knee.</li>
                      <li><span class="pinktext">Second,</span> Second, free weights are probably the most versatile.  The advantage of free weights over machines is that the body is required to completely engage in the lifting and lowering of the weight, as well as with balance.  Free weights require you to be completely responsible for the form and alignment of each movement thus capitalizing on maximum return on energy invested.  There is variety in the range of motion as well as quicker strength gains.  Equipment includes dumbbells, weight plates, weight set bars and collars.</li>
                      <li><span class="pinktext">Third,</span> Third is body weight resistance training which is the easiest.  It requires no equipment just your body weight and understanding how to position your body to work against gravity’s downward pull.  Popular exercises include push-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups.  You can increase strength and endurance as well as increase metabolism, improve coordination, balance and self-esteem.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2><span>A combination of circuit training and interval training can be blended to accomplish both resistance training and cardiovascular training simultaneously.  The goal is to overload the muscle with a strength training exercise and recover while engaging in a cardio exercise.  For example, you would do a bicep curl set followed by jumping rope and then do a triceps set followed by jogging in place.  Another option is to do a low weight with high reps with a very short recovery time between exercises.  The workout is designed to be easy to follow, target fat loss, build muscle, enhance lung and heart function as well as give you a great workout in a short duration of time.  The workout includes a warm-up, workout, post aerobic cool-down and stretching.</span>

                      <span>Training with balls and bands provide the illusion of all fun, but, don’t let that fool you.  Many professional athletes use this equipment exclusively to train for their sport since the flexibility of movement helps the athlete best mirror the moves in their individual sport.  Balls and bands are very portable, affordable and can be used at home.  Exercise balls are also called stability balls, gymnastic balls, or Swiss balls. Bands come in a tube shape or flat elastic sheets.  There are a number of exercises that can be performed using the balls alone or with bands.  Some examples include chest press with leg raises, seated lateral raises with hip flexion, one-legged lunges, bent over rows and squats.  Many of these moves require advanced coordination and skill.  You might want to spend some time with a personal trainer until you master the skill.</span></h2>

                    <p>Specific Body Part Training</p>
                    <h2><span>This section will break down each primary body part including the arms, abs, chest, back and legs. We will cover the basic muscle groups, their origin and insertion, primary function and give you some ideas of exercises you can do to improve each.</span>

                      <span>How you train is up to you and your goals.  You can do a full body workout, do opposing muscle splits, do upper and lower body parts on alternating days, etc.  For a good general workout for the average person, most trainers support low impact aerobics, stretching and training the core of the body on most days of the week.  So let’s get started covering the specific muscle group exercises for each body part that include using free weights, body weight and machine options.</span></h2>

Biceps are the muscles in the upper front of the arm. The origin and insertion is at the shoulder and elbow.  Their primary function is to flex (when the joint angle decreases) the elbow joint.  The triceps are the upper back of the arm and their primary function is to extend (when a joint angle increases) the arm.  We will add the shoulder in this upper body grouping. The shoulder consists of the deltoid located on the top of the shoulder.  Its function is to lift and lower the arm. The chest and back also connect to the shoulder ball and socket joint.  We will discuss those muscles in just a minute.<br><br>

                        <p><span class="pinktext">Abs:</span>  The anatomy of the abdominals include the rectus abdominals located on the front of the torso.  The primary function is to perform flexion of the spine.  The internal and external obliques located on the side of the abdominals allow the torso to rotate from side to side and contract at an angle allowing the opposite shoulder to contract toward the opposite hip.  The erector spinae is located in the lower back.  We will cover it here since it is the opposing muscle of the abdominals and performs extension of the spine.  The transverse muscle is located on the lower side and its function is to compress the abdomen.<br><br>

                          Here are some basic exercises for the abs.<br><br>

The origin and insertion of the pectoralis major attaches to the shoulder and the breastbone.  The primary function is to bring the humerus across the chest.  The pectoralis minor serves to move the shoulders forward.<br><br>

                          Here are some basic exercises for the chest:<br><br>

The primary function is to lift and lower the shoulder girdle.  The latissimus dorsi is the second muscle commonly called lats.  The lats are the largest muscle located in the middle of the back and it attaches to the pelvic girdle and spine.  Its function is to pull the arm toward the back like is done in a rowing motion.  Rhomboids are in the middle of the upper back attaching to the spine and scapula.  They function to hold the scapula against the thoracic wall.<br><br>

                        <p><span class="pinktext">Legs:</span>  The quadriceps is the large muscles in the front of the upper leg.  There are four different muscles that make up the quad grouping.  The quads work with the hamstrings in the back of the upper leg to create flexion and extension of the knee.  There are three muscles that make up the hamstring group.  Above the hamstring is the gluteus maximus also known as the glutes or the behind. The glutes work with the hip ilipsoas or commonly called hip flexors to provide flexion and extension of the hip.  The adductor is located on the upper inner thigh.  It works with the tensor fascia latae located on the outer upper thigh to do adduction (movement toward the midline of the body) and abduction (movement away from the midline of the body).  The gastocnemius and soleus make up the muscles in the back of the lower leg and the tibialis anterior is located on the front of the lower leg.  Together these muscles provide dorsi and plantar flexion of the ankle.<br><br>

                      <h2><span>As you have noticed some exercises can work more than one muscle group or body part.  In fact, you have over 600 muscles in your body and none of them work alone.  There are primary muscles that perform the basic muscle action.  There are secondary muscles that work in the opposite direction of the prime mover and there are synergistic muscles that support the movement or provide stability of other body parts.  For example, when you are doing a bench press the pecs are the primary movers.  The triceps also cause elbow extension and work to stabilize the movement of the shoulder joints.  Your abdominals stabilize your torso to support the press and the deltoid muscles help the chest to push the bar up.  All of these functions happen simultaneously to perform the press.  In addition, bones, respiratory and neurological system work in unison with the muscles to perform and sustain movement which is vital to your health.  When studying the human body, we are always in awe at both the complexity and simplicity of this amazing creation.  It is our responsibility to provide the necessary nutrients through good food selection, exercise aerobically and anaerobically and support the process with non-food supplementation for optimal well-being.</span></h2>

                    <p>Advanced Abs</p>
                    <div class="exercise-block4con7">
                      <h2><span>This section focuses on one of the more important sets of muscle groups, the abdominals.  It is probably not new to you but the abs are the "most popular" group of muscles people seek information on.  Not everyone cares about having big arms or a "ripped" back but they sure want sleek, well defined abs.  Since abs are so critical to peoples goals and "look," we compiled a set of frequently asked questions.</span></h2>
                      <div class="exercise-block4con7con">
                        <h2><span class="pinktext">What are the abdominal muscles?</span>

                          <span>The midsection of your body includes the rectus abdominous, serratus, internal and external obliques, psoas, linea alba, linea similunaris, linea transversae, transversalis and intercustals. The largest most apparent abdominal muscle group is the rectus abdominous. The rectus abdominous is a huge, flat muscle covering almost the entire front of your "stomach" area between the lower ribcage and your hips.</span>

                          <span>A second main set of muscles which comprise the "abs" are located at the sides of your waist. These muscles are referred to as the external obliques; however, they really consist of three separate muscle groups, the internal obliques, traverse obliques and the external obliques.</span>

                          <span>A final set of muscles which compose the "abs" are the incostals. The intercostals run diagonally down the sides of the upper end of your midsection right below the ribcage. These are normally the last muscles to appear to the naked eye, only visible in people who have taken the time to develop them properly.</span></h2>
                      </div>
                      <div class="exercise-block4con7con">
                        <h2><span class="pinktext">Why do you need great abs?</span>

                          <span>First, abdominal muscles are important for freedom from lower back pain and injury. You may not be aware of the fact that many lower back problems come from poor ab development rather than from weak spinal erectors.</span>

                          <span>Second, great abs also look fantastic. One of the first spots someone's appraising eye falls on is your midsection. Great abs tell others straight off that you are fit and care about your health and personal appearance. Third, strong abs are a key to improving performance in many sports.</span></h2>
                      </div>

                        <h2><span class="pinktext">How often should I train my abs?</span>

                          <span>The amount of abdominal training you need to do is dictated by what your specific goals are. If you are looking to flatten your tummy a little then you might be able to achieve that with 8-10 minutes of work 2 or 3 times weekly. If you are looking for that awesome, lean, six pack look then you had better be prepared to blast train your abs. If you think that you can achieve magazine type results with some "TV gizmo" or "infomercial whatchamacallit" you will be sadly disappointed. Great, rock hard abs can only be attained through hard, brutal ab workouts.</span>

                        <h2><span class="pinktext">How do I know I'm training my abs correctly?</span>

                          <span>You should feel a deep satisfying "burn" in each muscle group during every set.  Further, after each abs session your muscles should look and feel pumped much the same as other muscle groups.</span>

                        <h2><span class="pinktext">Are some ab exercises better than others?</span>

                          <span>Certainly, some exercises are better than others; however, we believe that everyone should experiment with different exercises to see which ones work best for them. The key is mental concentration. Research has demonstrated that muscle fiber recruitment is dictated most specifically by what area of the abs you are thinking about during ab training. For example, a set of crunches will recruit more upper ab fibers if you think about upper abs while the same set will recruit more lower ab fibers if you concentrate mentally on your lower abs.</span>

                        <h2><span class="pinktext">I heard "lower" ab work is useless since the "lower" abs don't really exist?</span>

                          <span>There is a huge debate in fitness as to whether "lower" abs exist. The debate is really foolish; "lower" abs definitely exist.  In fact, aside from obvious functional differences between upper and lower abs, the ab muscles below the navel are stimulated by a completely different set of those originating from the region of the first lumbar vertebra.  If the evidence is good enough for neurologists and kinesthislogists, then it is good enough for us.</span>

                          <span>Ab work can improve posture but if you do not achieve a balance of work between the "upper" and "lower" abs your posture may actually worsen.  For example, if your "upper" abs strengthens compared to the lower abs - the pull of the hip flexors will increase and cause your belly to stick further out. Or pelvic instability could result which could cause you to appear as if your back was arched.</span>

                          <span>Let's look at a few of our favorite common ab exercises.  This list is by no means an exhaustive one.  It just contains some common ab exercises that we like best.

                    <h1>The Five Components of the Perfect Workout</h1>
                    <div class="exercise-block5con1">
                      <h2><span>The final checklist that we want to review with you is the actual exercise and or physical activity session.</span>

                        <span>The six important areas that we want you to understand and be able to identify are the warm up, aerobic training component, post aerobic cool down, muscular training or anaerobic component and flexibility stretching.  Whatever the activity or activities you decide to engage in, it would be best to incorporate all five of those elements.  We can break them down individually.</span>

                        <span>The warm up is essential to prepare the body to engage in more strenuous activity.   It helps reduce the risk of injury, increases the core temperature of the body and allows the cardiovascular system to adjust blood flow.   The warm up should last between three and five minutes, depending on the activity you will do and your fitness level.  Typical warm-ups might involve moving your limbs around and rotating and bending the various joints.  More advanced warm-ups could involve jumping jacks and other typical calisthenics. </span>

                        <span>he aerobic training component improves body composition, the capacity of the heart and vascular system and is critical for achieving and maintaining ideal weight.  We know that the weight bearing aerobic activities like walking and jogging help to increase bone density and are especially helpful for individuals with diabetes.</span>

                        <span>The post aerobic section will follow the aerobic exercise.  This is usually three to five minutes in duration.  During the post aerobic period, simply do what you were doing during the aerobic time just at a slower pace.  This will allow the blood in the extremities to be balanced throughout the body.</span>
                      </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block5con2">
                      <h2><span>The muscular strength and muscular endurance anaerobic training should follow the aerobic training in a traditional workout since the muscles and connective tissue will be warmed up and ready to safely experience overload.  This can be done using free weights, machines, hydraulics, bands or even body weight engaging in exercises like lunges, sit-ups, pull-ups and push-ups.</span>

                        <span>There is considerable research indicating that the best anaerobic activities involve isometric exercise.  Isometric exercise is a form of exercise involving the static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint.</span>

                        <span>Last, you will need to engage in focused stretching of major joints surrounded by muscle groups.  Stretch and hold for a minimum of fifteen to thirty seconds per movement.   As the muscles and joints allow, continue to increase range of motion while performing a static stretch in alignment.  Try to stretch all the main muscles groups and joints.</span>

                        <span>Now it is time to set up our exercise schedule and think about how often, how hard, how long and what activity you will be focused on.</span>

                        <span>If you need help here, there is something called The <span class="pinktext3">FITT Principle</span> which is a set of guidelines that will help you determine an exercise schedule and will additionally help you to stay on track to reach your goals.   FITT Is an acronym made up of the first letters in Frequency, Intensity, Time and Type.  Each one of these variables will be critical to helping you reach and maintain your fitness goals.</span>
                      </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block5con3">
                      <h2><span>Let's start with <span class="pinktext3">frequency</span>.  In order to achieve maximum exercise results, you must work the cardiovascular system 3-5 times per week.  What that means is that you need to elevate your heart rate between 50-85% of your 100% capacity for a minimum of 20-30 minutes 3 to 5 times a week.</span>

                        <span>Keep in mind that if you are a beginner, you might want to start by exercising one to three times per week.  As your fitness level increases so should your number of training sessions.</span>

                        <span>If your goal is to lose weight you will need to train aerobically on most days of the week.  However, we do recommend that you get enough rest between sessions to minimize the risk for injury.</span>

                        <span>Regarding your anaerobic workout, generally, we recommend that you incorporate resistance training three times per week.  This workout should include overloading all of the major muscle groups.   Most people find the best success with working opposing muscles together.  For example, if you work the bicep, you need to work the triceps.   If you work the chest, you must work the back etc.  We recommend that you do resistance training after your aerobic training to ensure the muscles and surrounding tissue are warmed up and ready to engage in risk free weight training.</span>
                      </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block5con3">
                      <h2><span><span class="pinktext3">Intensity</span> is the second variable to consider.  In other words, how hard do you need to exercise?  The guidelines surrounding aerobic and anaerobic training are very clear.  Research shows that the aerobic training zone is between 50-85% for optimal results.  The range is broad to accommodate varying fitness levels as well as the different activities you can be involved in within one session.  For example, the heart rate responds very differently if you are walking verses running or if you are doing squats verses bicep curls.  Even if you are just running, you will rarely stay at one constant speed unless you are on a treadmill. If you are on a treadmill, notice that even if the speed is the same your heart rate will change based on energy expenditure.  In fact, heart rate can be an excellent indication of intensity.  Many people use the "talk test" method to judge this.  This method utilizes the breathing response to determine intensity.  If you are in the proper training zone, you should be able to speak in short choppy phrases.  If breathing is labored, the intensity is too high.</span>

                        <span>The third principle involves the duration of time to be spent exercising.  While the Surgeon General has recommended that everyone exercise a minimum of 30 minutes on most days of the week (as a response to the obesity epidemic we are facing and the cost associated with health care), most comprehensive exercise sessions should be about 60-90 minutes in length.  This includes the warm-up, aerobic training, post aerobic cool down, resistance training and flexibility stretching.  Given time is often limited with our busy lives some experts support the minimum workout time be at least ten minutes, however, that certainly seems far too short for us on most days.  If we are talking about simply being active throughout the day or by taking a brisk walk every few hours, any amount of time committed to movement is valuable, even if it does not increase aerobic capacity or muscular strength.</span>

                        <span>Another point to keep in mind is the relationship between intensity and duration.  Generally speaking, the greater the intensity of the activity, the shorter is the duration of it.  And the lower the intensity, the longer the duration can be.  An example of this is the differences in the aerobic capacity and oxygen delivery between running and walking.  It is much easier to walk for an hour as opposed to running for an hour.</span>
                      </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="exercise-block5con3">
                      <h2><span><span class="pinktext3">Type of activity</span> is the final principle we need to discuss.  The list of possible activities is nearly endless.   Walking, jogging, running, cycling, swimming, stair climbing, cross country skiing, rowing, dancing, circuit training and playing a number of sports are a few options to be considered.  As you know, you need to do something to support your cardiovascular system on most days of the week, so simply pick activities that you enjoy.   We also recommend that you do anaerobic activities three times per week.  That means resistance training with weights, bands, or with isometrics using your own body weight.  To finish each exercise session you need to incorporate stretching.  Stretching can be done anywhere, indoors or outside.</span>

                        <span>Improving your fitness and health is easy when you think about it in terms of the FITT Principle.  If your time is limited then take a look at how you can best benefit within the timeframe you have by increasing intensity.  If time is not a factor consider decreasing the intensity to gain duration and possibly add variety to your workout.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  We strongly encourage you to find a way to achieve optimal health.</span>

It is like its own sense of healing power. I get lost in the magic of these walks. I dont even remember my pain, or the stress of everyday life when I am on these walks. Finally, I arrived back home, Every time I get home after my outing, it's like a tear falls off my face. Until next time, it is a date.</span>

                      <p>Summary of Week 1</p>
                      <h2><span>Starting at the beginning of the week,  I began the 1st step to becoming the best Active woman I can be. One very important action is walking. Walking can help you benefit your life on so many levels. Not only can it help us with our physical health, but our psychological health as well. A recent study done by Southern California University Professor Robert Thayer, shows that walking each day will help you become more energetic and be in a better mood then you were if you are feeling down. It is truly incredible to me how just a stroll in a park, or a 20 minute dog walk a day can change your life. As I read this article I begin to understand how After every walk I felt filled with energy, I did not have before the walk. This is why I am doing all the work to bring the information, and facts to you, but for me it is not just work I truly enjoy every moment of my walks. I want to share them with you. I want everyone to benefit the way I get to benefit from the amazing pleasure. Free your mind, leave your stress at the door, see the beauty and feel the power of the walk. Ready! Set! It is time to start your journey to an Epic Life.</span></h2>

                      <h2><span><span class="pinktext3">Pre Walk</span> - Today is a very slow day. It is not my favorite time of the month. I would say I am at about a 4 out of a 10 today. Even though I don’t feel like doing much of anything today, I am still looking forward to my daily walk. I am hoping it can pick me and my body up.</span>

                        <span><span class="pinktext3">Walk</span> - I began my walk with the correct posture this week. As I started walking I could already feel the difference in my body. I could feel the burn. My body was building up strength in a much faster light. About 5 mins in, the pain I felt alday in my body was gone. My mind was freed. My imagination began to run wild. It was truly incredible. I would love to explain in death the beauty, but I could never do it any justice. It is something you must experience for yourself. By the end of my walk I was so pleased and happy with myself. Not to mention. I had my fastest mile yet, each day I only improve. Until next time!</span>

                      <h2><span><span class="pinktext3">Pre Walk</span> - I had a very productive day, my body was so sore and for the first time I was not 100% looking forward to my walk. Not to mention the week of the month I was dealing with, not my favorite. I was really hoping my walk would help build up my energy levels and my mood.</span>

                        <span><span class="pinktext3">Walk</span> - As I began my walk, I could already feel my mood elevating, I was becoming happier. Looking more forward to my walk. As I went on, my energy began to grow, my mind began to feel less stress. All of the worries and stresses I had before I started seem to slowly fade away. Now that I am walking with perfect posture, I can feel the burn in my body, the burn of muscle building. I did not even care that it hurt, I was enjoying myself too much. I wanted to keep going. Keep feeling this amazing feeling, all the joy and smiles that come from it. The creative state my mind goes into, it is just incredible in my eyes. My walk was ending and I was already looking forward to tomorrow. What a pleasurable experience.</span></h2>
                      <h2><span><span class="pinktext3">Pre Walk</span> - Pre Walk-I was looking forward to my walk, I had a very productive day, with a productive night to follow. I needed more energy. I knew the perfect solution to help me with that. Not to mention I had stomach pains all day.</span>

                        <span><span class="pinktext3">Walk</span> -Taking a deathe breathe and beginning my walk I began to feel the tension release I had been experiencing all day. FLow around my path of choice, my imagination began to widen. My energy levels high. I could feel it. The power of just a walk. I didn't even notice the stomach pain, I had to ask myself was I ever in pain to begin with. By the time I arrive home I didn't even realize I had walked longer. I was ready to begin class and give it my all. I had the energy and the right mindset all because I took the time to walk.</span></h2>

                      <h2><span><span class="pinktext3">Pre Walk</span> - Pre Walk- Not a good day for me. I was not happy in any manner, just mad at the world because of my day. I knew I needed to fix this mindset I was stuck in. The only way I knew how, and the only thing that has never let me down was walking. This day more then ever I can honestly say I have never been looking more forward to my walk.</span>

                        <span><span class="pinktext3">Walk</span> - I stood before my walk and just inhaled and exhaled 3 deep breathes. Beginning my walk I was in a stage of open mind. I could feel the relief happening within my body as I walked on.  I completely lost sight of the outside world and begin to see one I was creating. Filled with beauty in every turn you look. My body feel as if it was rebuilding its broken pieces. My anger began to lift away. I was becoming one with myself. Giving myself the restart and make a great day of  it. I turned my own frown upside down. I arrived back home realizing I had again went over my normal time. I did not care, I enjoyed my walk so much I wanted to do it again. It is nice when you can take matters into your own hands and get the results of it you want. This is exactly what I did, and you can do it to.</span></h2>

                      <p>Summary of Week 2</p>
                      <h2><span>Starting at the beginning of the week, I started the second phase of me becoming the most active I can be. Walking with the perfect posture, compared to last week when I walked freely. The 1st time I began walking I could feel the burn that I didn't feel when I would walk free. My muscle strength was not only improving, but at a more rapid paste, and I could feel it. It excited me.  I would fall into deeper meditation states while walking with correct posture. The amazing thoughts and life changing benefits that came from this week's walks was just incredible. I would say I did not have the best week of my life, but because of walking this week, I made it through the week, and I finished strong, ready to take over next week. Without walking I don't believe I would be able to feel this amazing. Still in shock at how simply walking 2 hours per week can really change your life, as it is changing my life everyday. I will never overlook the power of walking. I dont want anyone to ever over look this powerful technique. Ask yourself, how important is my mental mind set? If you answer very, than now is the time to start to create a better, stronger, healthier life for you, and all it takes is  only 2 hours a week. You can't beat that.</span></h2>

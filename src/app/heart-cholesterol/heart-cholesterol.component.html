                    <p>As a board certified cardiologist, it's important for you to understand that I want to give you the structure for your day to help you keep Cholesterol, Triglycerides, <span>HDL</span> and <span>LDL</span> problems away. It is my goal to make sure you are fully aware of what causes them, where they come from and what you can do about them yourself?</p>

                    <p>One of the most misunderstood risk factors in heart disease is cholesterol. The misunderstanding begins with what cholesterol is and the role that cholesterol actually plays in heart disease. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association are constantly changing their guidelines and have done so for many,many years as research and developments continue in this field. I will not bore you with the Guidelines and the outcome studies to date as this would take an extensive amount of time.</p>

                    <p>Very generally speaking, and we'll get to the more true detail later, the real connection between cholesterol and heart disease starts with <span>LDL-C</span> (low density lipoprotein cholesterol). This is the cholesterol that people refer to as ? cholesterol that should be as low as possible to help prevent your first heart attack or stroke or prevent a recurrence if a heart attack or stroke has already occurred. That isn't really an appropriate characterization due to the fact that you need <span>LDL</span> to survive- how low is too low has been a debate for years and is still unsettled. <span>LDL</span> transports cholesterol from the liver to the cells throughout the body to keep them healthy. It is also a precur-</p>

                    <h3>Keeping LDL low is the first goal of creating a healthy heart- but we need to make sure that all other risk factors are under control also such as <span>Hypertension, Smoking, Diabetes, Weight, Inflammation</span> and other markers of risk.</h3>
                    <p>Hypercholesterolemia, regardless of cause, is a major modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease. Hypercholesterolemia is usually asymptomatic until serum lipid levels are severely elevated, and well beyond the range at which cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased. Identification of patients who would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy, therefore, depends on screening of adults and certain children for high serum lipid levels, as well as obtaining a careful history to detect risk factors that suggest the patient would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy, even if serum lipid levels are 'normal'. Effective and well-tolerated therapy for lowering <span>LDL</span> cholesterol <span>(LDL-C)</span> is now available, and should receive widespread application yet there are side effects with all medicines which can be both annoying and rarely but possibly fatal. Epidemiologic studies predict that for each 1% reduction in the level of <span>LDL-C</span>, there is a 1% to 1.5% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events. Treatment goals for lipid-lowering therapy depend on risk stratification of the patient to identify appropriate lipid level 'targets'. Lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes, are also key in long-term management.</p>

                    <p>A second type of cholesterol is called <span>HDL-C</span> which is a High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol. This is often referred to as ... ? cholesterol since its primary job is to remove <span>LDL</span> from the bloodstream. <span>HDL</span> is short for high-density lipoprotein. Each bit of <span>HDL</span> cholesterol is a microscopic blob that consists of a rim of lipoprotein surrounding a cholesterol center. The <span>HDL</span> cholesterol particle is dense compared to other types of cholesterol particles, so it's called high-density. Cholesterol isn't all bad and is essential for life. In fact, cholesterol is an essential fat. It provides stability in every cell of your body. To travel through the bloodstream, cholesterol has to be transported by helper molecules called lipoproteins. Each lipoprotein has its own preferences for cholesterol, and each acts differently with the cholesterol it carries. </p>

                    <p>Experts believe <span>HDL</span> cholesterol may act in a variety of helpful ways that tend to reduce the risk for heart disease: <span>HDL</span> cholesterol scavenges and removes <span>LDL</span> -- or "bad" cholesterol. <span>HDL</span> reduces, reuses, and recycles <span>LDL</span> cholesterol by transporting it to the liver where it can be reprocessed. <span>HDL</span> cholesterol acts as a maintenance crew for the inner walls (endothelium) of blood vessels. Damage to the inner walls is the first step in the process of
                      atherosclerosis, which causes heart attacks and strokes. <span>HDL</span> scrubs the wall clean and keeps it healthy.</p>

                    <p>In order to find out if cholesterol is a risk factor for you, you should get a <span>VAP</span> Lipid Profile blood test or another one of the more advanced cholesterol screening tests such as the Lipoprotein Particle Profile or Berkeley Heart Laboratory testing to
                      illustrate how many particles you have and the subset of particles you have. You may have never heard of a <span>VAP</span> profile but it is far better than the common lipid panel blood test which includes a total cholesterol measure as well as, more
                      importantly, <span>LDL</span> and <span>HDL</span> and Triglycerides. If you have to rely on the less valuable basic test, optimally your goal for <span>LDL</span> should be under 100, although some physicians consider normal to be below 160 unless you have more risk factors for <span>CAD</span>. If you have found yourself with multiple risk factors, you really should try to get the <span>LDL</span> score below 70.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, your <span>HDL</span> should be 50 or higher with higher baselines for women. If it tests lower than 40, you have to consider yourself at high risk for heart disease. Exercise can raise your <span>HDL</span> and there are always medicines and other medical conditions that can affect your readings so you should fully discuss with your health care provider.</p>

                    <p>The better <span>VAP</span> Lipid Profile measures <span>LDL</span> in a more direct manner which is far more accurate and also gives you the values for the dangerous Small Dense ... <span>LDL</span> particles and the less dangerous Larger ... <span>LDL</span> particles. <span>VAP</span> includes measures of the aforementioned lipoprotein <span>A, IDL</span>, and <span>VLDL</span> which are better risk factor measurements than total cholesterol and <span>LDL</span>. It also splits <span>HDL</span> into <span>HDL-2</span> and <span>HDL-3</span> which are functionally different. <span>HDL-2</span> is a very protected form of <span>HDL</span> and if the levels of this are low, it presents a significant risk factor for developing heart disease.You can readily see why the <span>VAP</span> test is better as general <span>HDL</span> level can be as misleading as to risk as a general cholesterol measure can be. Most abnormal cholesterol levels can be rather quickly improved with the proper diet of higher fiber, less saturated and trans fat diets. Less simple sugars lower the chance of glycation which can help as well. The one exception is that elevated lipoprotein A seems to be more hereditary in origin and does not respond well to diet modifications or even conventional cholesterol lowering drugs. There is research, however, indicating that a 3 gram cocktail of equal parts Vitamin <span>C</span>, Lysine and Proline can effect a positive change.</p>

                    <p>Triglyceride level is basically the amount of fat molecules circulating in the blood. There is considerable debate as to whether triglycerides are a risk factor independent of <span>LDL</span> cholesterol. Our position is that from a practical standpoint, for most, this is a moot debate, as lifestyle modifications that lower triglycerides also lower <span>LDL</span> and visa- versa for the most part.</p>

There will be a full discussion of statin drugs on a later day dealing with this important class of pharmaceuticals. Triglycerides can be measured with conventional lipid profile tests or the more sophisticated <span>VAP</span> test discussed recently.
                      Traditionally, medical doctors tell people that
                      triglyceride values should be under 150, however, that seems high to us. There is ample research
                      suggesting that triglycerides become an important risk factor above a measurement of 100. </p>

                    <h2>FACTOIDS</h2>
                    <p>50 % of the population has an increased plasma lipid level or abnormal cholesterol blood test result as a result of genetics and/or environment resulting in increased risk of Coronary heart disease. This marker needs to be incorporated into a multi variety risk factor formula to fully assess a persons risk of having a cardiovascular event.</p>

                    <p>10-20 % of population in the USA has a fasting Triglyceride level - TG-over 200 mg/dl and is usually higher in Diabetics and Obese individuals</p>

                    <p>Total cholesterol- TC and LDLC - Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol- levels rise about 20% in men ages 20-50</p>

                    <p>Total cholesterol- TC and LDLC - Low density Lipoprotein Cholesterol rise steadily about 30% in women ages 20-60</p>

                    <p>There is a higher incidence of lipid abnormalities in men as opposed to women with wide differences among ethnicity with Chinese having the lowest risk and Asian Indians having the highest risk for given levels of cholesterol</p>

                    <p>Mean plasma lipid levels vary between different populations around the world and within different ethnic groups in North America which can be partly explained by dietary and lifestyle differences as well as genetic influences. There are many studies discussing
                      cholesterol issues as well as treatment with medicines and the results on morbidity and mortality that I will not discuss in this brief introduction.</p>
